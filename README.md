# Word-Generator-using-POS

The word generator is the culmination of various NLP concepts that i learnt in my coursework:
It follows the following trail:
- Pre-processes data from a text (eg. book)
- POS tag the each word using Spacy library
- Making Data set, with previous words and POS tag of the word to be generated
- Tokenising and Making word vocab for the Dataset made and cleaning it a bit more
- Finally run that through the model that predicts the POS tag to follow
- Using the POS tag we use Markov principle to find the most likely word
- I have presented upto 3 possible options for a user

**NOTE: This can be applied to assist in writing books or novels if trained or huge datasets**
